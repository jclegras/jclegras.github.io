My name is *Jean-Charles Legras*, and I’ve been an *[SRE/DevOps](https://romain.soufflet.io/work/devops/sre/2018/08/11/sre-devops-que-font-ils)* for over 10 years.

The world of DevOps practices and tools excites me every day, and this blog is a reflection of my ongoing journey and discoveries in this ever-evolving field.

It’s primarily a personal knowledge base and a showcase, but I hope it resonates with others who might stumble upon it in search of answers or inspiration.

If you’d like to connect or discuss, don’t hesitate to reach out. This profession and passion are, first and foremost, about people, and I’d be happy to respond as my schedule allows.
